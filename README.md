# Water-Level-Controller-using-Arduino-Uno

Objective:
	To automate home water pump systems that pump water from the sump to overhead tank by using water-level sensor and ultrasonic sensor.

Abstract:
	The water pump automation system has been built using an arduino uno microcontroller board. A water level sensor and ultrasonic sensor are installed on the overhead tank to enable detection of water level. A water level threshold is set; when the readings of the sensors fall below the threshold a signal is sent to the motor and the motor is switched on. An LCD module is also installed which allows us to continuously monitor water level readings.
